# TestProject-GitHubAPI

##Description##
Test app using GitHub API:

- Localization, ...
- Cocoapods
  - Whisper
  - RealmSwift
  - Alamofire
  - SwiftyJSON
  - NVActivityIndicatorView
  - SDWebImage

The quality of GIF animation is very low, I suggest you to download the project and launch it using simulator.

*Wait for gif presentation, it's loading...*
