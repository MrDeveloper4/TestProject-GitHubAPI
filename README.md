# TestProject-GitHubAPI

##Description##
Test app using GitHub API:

- Localization, ...
- Cocoapods
  - Whisper
  - RealmSwift
  - Alamofire
  - SwiftyJSON
  - NVActivityIndicatorView
  - SDWebImage

##THIS project was created a long time ago: its structure is ugly, not readable, without following S.O.L.I.D. princeples, and so on and so on. I just don't want to delete it, because it's the only project where I had a chance to play with GitHub API.##

The quality of GIF animation is very low, I suggest you to download the project and launch it using simulator.

*Wait for gif presentation, it's loading...*
